# homework-management

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

```

### What i have used: 
- Tailwind css for the login page.
- Nuxtjs - to fast develop without create any route.
- Vuex - to store my mock data.
- <s>Axios mock adapter - to simulate http requests</s> scratch that
- Vue-Treeselect - to list teachers and students
- Bootstrap-vue - to build some boxes
- Mockapi - i stored my student/teacher/admin data into the [Mockapi](https://mockapi.io/clone/6192b13fd3ae6d0017da823f)
### The principle: 
- You have to check the sign in as teacher if you login as teacher. Otherwise you can login with student account

### Posibble Errors

- Some '[Vue-Treeselect Warning]' errors can be occur due to non unique values. Anyways just ignore the Vue-Treeselect errors.

- You can be lost your route in Admin page.

- You can be face the ts type errors due to vue types.
### Not working

- You cant upload any doc to the set assigment for the students's homework
